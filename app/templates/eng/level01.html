Makłowicz starts searching the garbage bags, but quickly notices that they are full of various wastes and it is not known
which one contains his key. So he has to come up with a plan. He decides to search the bags one by one, but he
realizes that it will take him a long time. Help Makłowicz find the key by searching the garbage - source code of the page.</p>

    <h2>{{ page }}</h2>
    <p>Comments in HTML code are used to describe page elements and are ignored by web browsers.
        Unfortunately, some programmers leave information there that should be confidential, such as passwords, keys
        encryption or authorization tokens. This in turn creates the risk of their use by unauthorized persons or
        bots, which can lead to data leakage or violation of user privacy.</p>

    <p>Using comments to store confidential information is one of the easiest ways to
        unauthorized access to systems. Attackers can search the page source code to find them
        information and then use it to gain access to sensitive data.</p>
    <p>
        That is why it is important that programmers exercise caution and do not leave confidential information in HTML code
        as a comment. Instead, confidential data should be stored in secure locations such as databases
        configuration files or environment variables.
    </p>
    <p>It is worth remembering that cybersecurity is a key element for both users and programmers who create applications
        and websites. Leaving confidential information in HTML code as a comment is a serious threat to the privacy and
        security of users, so it should not take place in cybersecurity projects.</p>
