{% block walkthrough %}
    <h2>{{ page }}</h2>
    <p>Many applications, especially those with the login option, have access to some database. It turns out that
        knowing the basics of SQL, a hacker can easily break into an unsecured base and steal from it various sensitive
        information or modify or even delete it. There are many different ways in which the attacker can commit this
        type of attack.</p>
    <p>Let's look at the following query:</p>
    <img style="max-width: 100%" src="/static/files/w4.1.png"/>
    <p>After entering the above text in the search engine, we ask przykładowa-strona.pl to call in their database the
        following command:</p>
    <img style="max-width: 100%" src="/static/files/w4.2.png"/>
    <p>Which we can translate as:
        "Display all items from the " shop "table, which are furniture (have the value" furniture "in the" type "column)
        and are currently on sale (their value in the column" in_sales "is equal to 1). "</p>
    <p>The above procedure happens every time the user searches for a product on the site or filters search results.</p>
    <p>If the attacker wanted to access products that are currently not on sale (their value in the column in_sales is
        equal to 0), He could try to comment out the part related to information about the sale of a given product -
        then this condition would not be taken into account at all when searching for items in the database. Comments in
        SQL are preceded by two dashes.</p>
    <img style="max-width: 100%" src="/static/files/w4.3.png"/>
    <p>The above text would be translated into a query:</p>
    <img style="max-width: 100%" src="/static/files/w4.4.png"/>
    <p>It is worth noting that here the whole phrase 'AND in_sales = 1' is treated as a comment.</p>
    <p>In the event that the attacker wanted to display all products, regardless of their type, he could ask the query
        in the following way:</p>
    <img style="max-width: 100%" src="/static/files/w4.5.png"/>
    <p>Adding the condition to the search "OR 1 = 1" makes the query about the type of products always true, no matter
        whether the product is furniture or not.</p>
    <p>Finally, it should be mentioned that the query text in the page address changes depending on what is entered in
        the search engine on the page or clicked on it.</p>
