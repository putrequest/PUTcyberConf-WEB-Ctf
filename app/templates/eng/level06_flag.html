    <p> Well done! The prison authorities, checking the cameras, will find there Robert Astley's iconic hit "Never gonna
        give you up".
        We have received information from Gordon Ramsay's classified intelligence regarding the secret key necessary to
        perform the operation - it has the value "v32y_53cu23_k3y"</p>

{% block walkthrough %}
    <h2>{{ page }}</h2>
    <p>One of the existing authentication tools is the JWT (Json Web Token).</p>
    <p>When a user logs into a web application, the server generates a JWT that contains the user's identity and any
        other relevant information such as their role or permissions. The token is then sent to the user, who stores it
        locally, usually in a browser cookie or local storage. On subsequent requests to the server, the token is sent
        back to the server as an authorization header, allowing the server to verify the user's identity and grant
        access to protected resources or functionality.</p>
    <p>This mechanism allows you to confirm the user's identity, but it can also be a vulnerability in the system. Data
        sent in the form of cookies is encrypted</p>

    <p></p>
    <p>There are services dedicated to debugging and verifying tokens. Just as they can be useful in testing
        applications, an attacker can use them to decode encrypted cookies, as well as to modify them.An example of a
        website that allows you to generate a JWT Token is <a href="https://jwt.io/">jwt.io</a>.</p>
    <img style="max-width: 100%" src="/static/files/w6.2.png"/>
    <p>Using the jwt.io tool, we can decode the original token and modify the payload to include the appropriate data or
        permissions.
        A secret key is often used for encryption.
        After generating a new token, it is possible to replace the original value with it.
        After sending a request with a modified token and accepting it by the server, the attacker is authenticated - he
        can gain access to user accounts and related sensitive information or permissions.</p>
