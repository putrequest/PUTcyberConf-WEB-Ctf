        <h2>{{ page }}</h2>
        <p>Cookie manipulation is a type of web exploitation that occurs when a website's authentication mechanism relies on cookie values to identify users and grant them access to specific areas or features. An attacker can manipulate cookie values to bypass the authentication process and gain unauthorized access to areas or features of the website that are restricted.</p>
        <p>A website may have a cookie that identifies whether a user is an administrator or not by using the logical values of "true" or "false." An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by intercepting the cookie data and changing the logical value from "false" to "true," granting themselves administrator privileges on the website.</p>
        <p>After gaining administrator access, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious actions such as stealing sensitive data, modifying or deleting content, or creating new user accounts with elevated privileges.</p>
