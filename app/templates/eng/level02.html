        <p> Congratulations! Makłowicz finds the key to the cell. He opens the door quietly and goes out to the corridor of the prison, sneaking past the sleeping guard on duty. <br>
Makłowicz also wants to save his four-legged friend, but he doesn't know where he is at the moment. He only heard that the dogs in this prison are trained and rehabilitated by robots. Fortunately, the dog has a collar with his location. Find out the dog is held at and rescue him.

        <p>The robots.txt file is used to pass instructions to web "robots" regarding the location on the website, where they do not have access to for indexing or scanning. The existence of the robots.txt file itself does not constitute any security vulnerability on the website, but it is often used to identify limited or private areas of website content. The information contained in this file can help the attacker map the contents of the website. If the website relies on the robots.txt file to protect access to these areas, while not applying appropriate access control to them, it is a serious vulnerability.</p>
